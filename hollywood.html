            The ATI Hollywood GPU was a small improvement over the previous generation of systems boasting a 50% faster clock speed. This was due to the Wii not being aimed towards improving graphics, but rather improving the affordability of the system in order to appeal to a wider audience. This tactic worked as it lead the Wii to be the best selling console of it's generation.
